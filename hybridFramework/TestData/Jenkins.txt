1) Download Jenkins war file
2) Extract in folder
3) java -jar war_file_path 
OR
java -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java
by default it starts at port 8080, if its busy port, we can set the same in above command as follows
java -jar war_file_path --httpPort=8084
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8084 --enable-future-java
4) As soon as we run war file, a folder will be created in users folder with name .jenkins
all the setting, tasks, jobs, plugins, configs will be stored here

For emails,
when 2 step verification is on, create app passwords
and put this credentials in jenkins username password
